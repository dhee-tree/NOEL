# NOEL
NOEL is an application for family and friends to play Secret Santa remotely accross the world.

## How it works
A group representative contacts NOEL to create a group with the names and email addresses of the participants. 

NOLE admin would:
1. Create the group.
2. Add participants.
3. Send message to the group on how to access their account.
4. Each participant will be able to see who they have to give a gift to.
5. Each participant will not be able to see who they will receive a gift from.
